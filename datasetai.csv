Which I'm not saying is bad at all, in fact I think it worked for a lot of people. The reason I don't like it is because you basically become a recruiting company and every model has its benefits and problems. The agency model has a benefit because it's super easy to sell agency services. The build and release model slash offer is beneficial because it's better for you. You don't have to manage people ongoing like a team and you can just place talent in other people's businesses. There's like the growth partner model. You take 10% revenue share. That also for me was too complicated. I don't wanna have only 5-10 clients that produce all my revenue cause there's so much risk involved in that. If one of those clients leave 25% of your revenue's cut out, I personally think is the best if you want simplicity, high margins, and great client results.
